## General

### What’s a database
A database is a structured collection of data organized into tables, which consist of rows and columns. Each table represents a specific entity or concept, such as users, products, orders, etc. Within a table, columns define the different attributes or properties of the entity, and rows contain the actual data or records.

ACID Compliance: MySQL ensures the reliability and consistency of data through support for ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties. This guarantees that database transactions are processed reliably and accurately.

### What’s a relational database
A relational database is a type of database management system (DBMS) that organizes and stores data in a tabular form, consisting of tables, rows, and columns. It follows the principles of the relational model, which was introduced by Edgar F. Codd in 1970. Relational databases are widely used and provide a structured and efficient way to store and manage large amounts of data.
- Rows: Each row in a table represents a single instance or record of the entity being modeled. Each row contains values that correspond to the columns or attributes defined for the table.
- Columns: Columns define the attributes or properties of the entity being represented. Each column has a specific data type (such as text, numeric, date, etc.) and a name that describes the information it holds.
- Keys: In relational databases, keys are used to uniquely identify each row in a table. The primary key is a column or combination of columns that uniquely identifies each record in the table. Other columns may have foreign keys that establish relationships between tables.
- Relationships: Relational databases allow establishing relationships between tables using keys. The most common relationship types are one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many. These relationships define how data in one table is related to data in another table.
