Background Context

In this project, you will review everything about Python:

    Import
    Exceptions
    Class
    Private attribute
    Getter/Setter
    Class method
    Static method
    Inheritance
    Unittest
    Read/Write file

You will also learn about:

    args and kwargs
    Serialization/Deserialization
    JSON

Step by step

    Write the first class Base
    Write the class Rectangle that inherits from Base
    Update the class Rectangle by adding validation of all setter methods and instantiation (id excluded)
    Update the class Rectangle by adding the public method def area(self): that returns the area value of the Rectangle instance
    Update the class Rectangle by adding the public method def display(self): that prints in stdout the Rectangle instance with the character # - you donâ€™t need to handle x and y here
    Update the class Rectangle by overriding the str method so that it returns [Rectangle] instance
    Update the class Rectangle by improving the public method def display(self): to print in stdout the Rectangle instance with the character # by taking care of x and y
    Update the class Rectangle by adding the public method def update(self, *args): that assigns an argument to each attribute
    Update the class Rectangle by updating the public method def update(self, *args): by changing the prototype to update(self, *args, kwargs) that assigns a key/value argument to attributes
    Write the class Square that inherits from Rectangle
    Update the class Square by adding the public getter and setter size
    Update the class Square by adding the public method def update(self, *args, kwargs) that assigns attributes
    Update the class Rectangle by adding the public method def to_dictionary(self): that returns the dictionary representation of a Rectangle
    Update the class Square by adding the public method def to_dictionary(self): that returns the dictionary representation of a Square
    Update the class Base by adding the class method def savetofile(cls, listobjs): that writes the JSON string representation of listobjs to a file
    Update the class Base by adding the static method def fromjsonstring(jsonstring): that returns the list of the JSON string representation jsonstring
    Update the class Base by adding the class method def create(cls, dictionary): that returns an instance with all attributes already set
    Update the class Base by adding the class method def loadfromfile(cls): that returns a list of instances
